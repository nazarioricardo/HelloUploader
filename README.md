# HelloUploader
Upload to meLikee's Cloudkit database from iPhone

## Why?
Because Cloudkit's dashboard only uploads one file at a time, and I need to upload audio files en masse.

## What kind of code can I find here?
The CloudkitManager singleton has some standard Objective-c methods for uploading media files to Cloudkit.

## What's coming next?
I am looking into different cloud API's to see if I can upload files directly from them, instead of having
to save a new ad-hoc deployment everytime I need to upload new files.
